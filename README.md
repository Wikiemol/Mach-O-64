Mach-O 64 File Parser
====================

An incomplete mach-o 64 bit executable file parser I made for HexFiend.
To use it, just git clone this repository in your templates folder.

Why have I made this?
----------------------

Despite Mach-O being the standard executable file format for OSX, there's very little written about this file format on the internet. The official Apple website has removed their documentation regarding this file format and the documentation they did have is outdated. Furthermore, most books on assembly language programming and operating systems design focus on Linux or Windows. For someone who has a Mac and doesn't want to bother booting linux to learn how executable programs work on the machine code level, it would be nice to have a free resource that explains the basics of computer systems on a low level in a way that caters to Mac users. 

I am doing this in part as a resource for others and in part as a way of teaching myself, so none of this is meant to be taken as gospel. However, as I update this with information that I have learned, I hope it will help people who, like me, want to understand whats going on when they compile and run a program.
