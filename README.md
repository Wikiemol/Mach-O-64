Mach-O 64 File Parser
====================

An incomplete mach-o 64 bit executable file parser I made for HexFiend.
To use it, just git clone this repository in your templates folder.
Mainly made this to help me learn lower level programming and document the Mach-O file type, because Apple has taken down their official documentation. Checkout [the wiki](https://github.com/Wikiemol/Mach-O-64/wiki) where I document what I have learned.
